I’m Sarah Riazati, a front-end engineer with a unique blend of skills in web development, UX design and product strategy. 

For me, front-end development is more than writing code. I approach it as a collaborative craft, where design and code are two sides of the same coin. My philosophy is rooted in curiosity, creativity, and iteration. I love learning new tools and working in teams to build scalable systems for product operations. 

I’m equally comfortable leading brainstorms to sketch UX journeys, coding reusable, well-documented components, or diving into troubleshooting tricky browser edge cases. 

My nontraditional path—from documentary filmmaker to college lecturer to freelance developer—has made me a curious, adaptable problem solver who thrives in fast-paced environments. Years of freelancing makes me a collaborative problem solver and strategic thinker who brings clarity and structure to complex challenges.
